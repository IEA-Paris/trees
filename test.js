Jean de Meun’s continuation of the poem fuses themes from medieval satire and love-poetry with a wide range of philosophical questions that show a particular concern for contemporary controversies and issues. The speeches by central characters such as Reason, Nature and Genius are saturated with references to both ancient _auctores_ and more recent, scholastic debates. But while there is widespread consensus about the encyclopaedic range of themes evoked by the poem, and about Jean’s presence in the cultural orbit of the University, little work has been done in assessing the intellectual and cultural significance of his engagement with philosophical materials. While in the 1940s Gérard Paré could still claim that Jean was merely ‘un vulgarisateur et un traducteur’ who ‘continue de mettre à la portée des laïcs les rudiments de sa science universitaire’, it is now clear that this is an unsatisfactory assessment. On the one hand, Jean’s understanding of philosophical problems debated in Paris during the 1260s and 70s appears to be far more precise and informed than Paré allowed for. On the other, Jean’s handling of such materials is often provocative, critical and creative, and the poem cannot be reduced to a patchwork of mere ‘allusions’ to scholastic theories and debates. Seeing the _Roman de la Rose_ in terms of a passive ‘adoptions’ of philosophical positions elaborated by the scholastics is therefore inaccurate. Jean’s poem is a self-conscious, deeply informed, and intellectually challenging intervention in the intellectual debates of its time. Attempting to justify this claim raises a whole range of larger, more profound questions regarding the interface between poetry and philosophy as it is deployed in the _Rose_ and as it influences later medieval poetry.\n\nThe _Roman de la Rose_ has seen much recent critical attention from literary scholars but its engagements with medieval thought have not been explored as, for example, Dante’s have been. The conference will enrich our understanding of the _Roman de la Rose_ itself and its cultural and intellectual significance in the history of philosophy as well as of literature by encouraging a sustained dialogue between philosophers, intellectual historians and literary historians. The _Rose_ juxtaposes a whole range of different currents and debates in thirteenth-century thought and by reading it in the light of that thought, we also hope to reveal connections between different aspects of medieval philosophy as well as between philosophy and poetry. It is our hope that such collaboration will shed light on the complexity of the poem not least by allowing an understanding of the idiosyncratic poetico-philosophical method of the _Rose_, which challenges current disciplinary barriers as well as medieval ones. We invite participants to explore any topic pertinent to the poem’s engagement with thirteenth-century university culture and learning—philosophy, theology and scientific knowledge more broadly.

              fr: "Avec la Divine Comédie de Dante, _Le Roman de la Rose_ est le poème médiéval en langue vernaculaire le plus répandu et le plus important en termes d’influence (plus de 300 manuscrits). Il s’agit également d’une œuvre d’une complexité intellectuelle formidable : la continuation de Jean de Meun en particulier, tout en faisant converger les traditions de la poésie courtoise et amoureuse avec la tradition de la satire médiévale, manifeste également un intérêt soutenu pour des questions philosophiques.Les discours des personnages du Roman—particulièrement Raison, Nature et Génius—regorgent non seulement de citations d’auteurs anciens, mais résonnent également avec de nombreux débats philosophiques contemporains, et les nombreuses controverses qui secouent l’Université de Paris.\n\nLes critiques soulignent volontiers la dimension encyclopédique du Roman, et insistent sur la culture scientifique et universitaire de son auteur/continuateur, mais peu de chercheurs se sont intéressés de près aux implications philosophiques et intellectuelles plus profondes du dialogue de Jean de Meun avec la scolastique. Dans les années 1940 Gérard Paré pouvait encore maintenir que Jean de Meun était simplement ‘un vulgarisateur et un traducteur’ ‘qui continue de mettre à la portée des laïcs les rudiments de sa science universitaire’, mais à la lumière de travaux plus récents il est évident que cette appréciation est insuffisante et réductrice. Premièrement, Jean manifeste une compréhension bien plus précise et nuancée des problématiques philosophiques débattues à l’Université de Paris pendant les années 1260 et 1270 de ce que pouvaient suggérer les travaux de Paré, doublée d’une sensibilité particulière à l’égard des controverses institutionnelles à l’intérieur de l’Université elle-même. Deuxièmement, l’évocation de ces questions de la part de Jean de Meun ne peut être réduite à une série de simples ‘allusions’ à des termes, méthodes et débats scholastiques, mais suggère une visée philosophique plus large, bien plus profonde et plus complexe, dont le mécanisme et la signification reste à explorer. Il n’est donc plus possible de voir le Roman de la Rose comme un simple tissu de citations et d’allusions plus ou moins confuses et aléatoires à la culture scholastique, ni comme un texte qui ‘adopte’ des solutions philosophiques préexistantes de façon passive et dérivative. Bien plutôt, le Roman de la Rose apparaît comme un poème qui intervient activement, de façon précise, souvent provocatrice et irrévérente, dans les débats philosophiques et théologiques de l’époque.\n\nGrâce à son influence profonde et durable sur le développement de la littérature et la culture vernaculaire de la fin du Moyen Âge, le Roman occupe une position privilégié dans la longue et complexe historie des relations entre scholastique et poésie, philosophie et littérature. Le cas du Roman de la Rose soulève donc une série d’importantes questions annexes, surtout d’ordre méthodologique, concernant l’interface entre discours philosophique et forme littéraire que nous nous proposons d’aborder également dans le cadre de ce colloque. La rencontre vise donc à enrichir notre compréhension du Roman de la Rose lui-même, en tant que poème et en tant qu’expression d’une réflexion philosophique, en encourageant le dialogue entre spécialistes de différentes disciplines—philosophie, histoire intellectuelle, et littérature. Cette démarche vise donc également à mettre à jour des dynamiques intellectuelles, culturelles et institutionnelles plus larges dans lesquelles le Roman est impliqué, tout en prêtant une attention particulière à la méthode poético-philosophique hautement personnelle développée par Jean de Meun, qui nous oblige à remettre en question toute sorte de barrière disciplinaire, autant moderne que médiévale. Nous invitons donc les participants à explorer un ou plusieurs aspects de l’engagement du Roman avec les débats philosophiques et théologiques de l’époque, ou ses relations avec la culture universitaire ou scientifique au sens plus large.

Il s’agit également d’une œuvre d’une complexité intellectuelle formidable : la continuation de Jean de Meun en particulier, tout en faisant converger les traditions de la poésie courtoise et amoureuse avec la tradition de la satire médiévale, manifeste également un intérêt soutenu pour des questions philosophiques.Les discours des personnages du Roman—particulièrement Raison, Nature et Génius—regorgent non seulement de citations d’auteurs anciens, mais résonnent également avec de nombreux débats philosophiques contemporains, et les nombreuses controverses qui secouent l’Université de Paris.\n\nLes critiques soulignent volontiers la dimension encyclopédique du Roman, et insistent sur la culture scientifique et universitaire de son auteur/continuateur, mais peu de chercheurs se sont intéressés de près aux implications philosophiques et intellectuelles plus profondes du dialogue de Jean de Meun avec la scolastique. Dans les années 1940 Gérard Paré pouvait encore maintenir que Jean de Meun était simplement ‘un vulgarisateur et un traducteur’ ‘qui continue de mettre à la portée des laïcs les rudiments de sa science universitaire’, mais à la lumière de travaux plus récents il est évident que cette appréciation est insuffisante et réductrice. Premièrement, Jean manifeste une compréhension bien plus précise et nuancée des problématiques philosophiques débattues à l’Université de Paris pendant les années 1260 et 1270 de ce que pouvaient suggérer les travaux de Paré, doublée d’une sensibilité particulière à l’égard des controverses institutionnelles à l’intérieur de l’Université elle-même. Deuxièmement, l’évocation de ces questions de la part de Jean de Meun ne peut être réduite à une série de simples ‘allusions’ à des termes, méthodes et débats scholastiques, mais suggère une visée philosophique plus large, bien plus profonde et plus complexe, dont le mécanisme et la signification reste à explorer. Il n’est donc plus possible de voir le Roman de la Rose comme un simple tissu de citations et d’allusions plus ou moins confuses et aléatoires à la culture scholastique, ni comme un texte qui ‘adopte’ des solutions philosophiques préexistantes de façon passive et dérivative. Bien plutôt, le Roman de la Rose apparaît comme un poème qui intervient activement, de façon précise, souvent provocatrice et irrévérente, dans les débats philosophiques et théologiques de l’époque.\n\nGrâce à son influence profonde et durable sur le développement de la littérature et la culture vernaculaire de la fin du Moyen Âge, le Roman occupe une position privilégiée dans la longue et complexe histoire des relations entre scholastique et poésie, philosophie et littérature. Le cas du Roman de la Rose soulève donc une série d’importantes questions annexes, surtout d’ordre méthodologique, concernant l’interface entre discours philosophique et forme littéraire que nous nous proposons d’aborder également dans le cadre de ce colloque. La rencontre vise donc à enrichir notre compréhension du Roman de la Rose lui-même, en tant que poème et en tant qu’expression d’une réflexion philosophique, en encourageant le dialogue entre spécialistes de différentes disciplines—philosophie, histoire intellectuelle, et littérature. Cette démarche vise donc également à mettre à jour des dynamiques intellectuelles, culturelles et institutionnelles plus larges dans lesquelles le Roman est impliqué, tout en prêtant une attention particulière à la méthode poético-philosophique hautement personnelle développée par Jean de Meun, qui nous oblige à remettre en question toute sorte de barrière disciplinaire, autant moderne que médiévale.\n\n#### Programme\n\n**Lundi 20 juin**\n\n9.00 Arrival and registration\n\n9.15-9.30 Welcome\n\n**9.30-11 Session 1 — University Culture  \n**Chair : Ian Wei (Bristol)  \nOlga Weijers (The Hague / IRHT Paris) : _Jean de Meun et la Faculté des Arts de Paris_                   \n  \nAlex Novikoff (Fordham University, NY) : _Performing Scholasticism: The Poetics of Disputation in 13th-Century Vernacular Poetry_\n\n11-11.30 Coffee\n\n**11.30 -13.00 Session 2 — Knowledge and Truth  \n**Chair : Aurélien Robert (CNRS)  \nFabienne Pomel (Université de Rennes 2) : _Expériences visuelles et fiction allégorique : lexique et paradigme de la fantasie chez Jean de Meun  \n_  \nJonathan Morton (King’s College, London) : _Sophisms and Sophistry in the ‘Roman de la Rose’_\n\n13.00-14.30 Lunch\n\n**14.30-16.00 Session 3 — Language**  \nChair: Irène Rosier (EPHE / CNRS / Paris 7)  \n  \nMarco Nievergelt (IEA Paris / Université de Lausanne) : _Impropriety, Equivocation, and Imposition: Jean de Meun and Parisian Grammar and Logic  \n_  \nEarl Jeffrey Richards (Bergische Universität Wuppertal) : Significatio ad placitum: _The Virtue Ethics Context of Jean de Meun’s Discussion of Linguistic Referentiality_\n\n16.00-16.30 Coffee\n\n**16.30-18.00 Session 4 — Uncertainty and Negation  \n**Chair: Amandine Mussou (Paris 7)  \nAlice Lamy (Univ.

Far from being a ‘canonical’ work in the ordinary sense, the _Rose_ in fact invites its readers to interrogate the very notion of literary authorship and discursive authority. Rather than affirming his own identity as author in self-confident fashion, as many readers of this influential poem assume, Jean de Meun’s attitude towards his own poetic craft is in fact deeply ambivalent and ironic. This culminates in the exact centre of the poem, with the appearance of the character of Faux Semblant, the embodiment of hypocrisy and deception. As a personification of the liar-paradox, Faux Semblant thus crystallises a whole range of anxieties concerning the epistemological status of literary fiction, and this concern comes to play a central role in later European literature influenced by the _Rose_, notably in the work of such figures as Machaut and Deguileville in France, Langland and Chaucer in England, or Dante and his contemporaries in Italy. In this paper I propose an initial sketch for a wider study of a European reception history of the _Rose_, with particular attention to the ethical function of poetry, and its problematic, unstable relation to truth and deception.\n\n[Plus d'informations (site de la Magdalene Society of Medievalists)](https://magdalenemedievalists.wordpress.com/colloquia/)",

This culminates in the exact centre of the poem, with the appearance of the character of Faux Semblant, the embodiment of hypocrisy and deception. As a personification of the liar-paradox, Faux Semblant thus crystallises a whole range of anxieties concerning the epistemological status of literary fiction, and this concern comes to play a central role in later European literature influenced by the _Rose_, notably in the work of such figures as Machaut and Deguileville in France, Langland and Chaucer in England, or Dante and his contemporaries in Italy. In this paper I propose an initial sketch for a wider study of a European reception history of the _Rose_, with particular attention to the ethical function of poetry, and its problematic, unstable relation to truth and deception.\n\n[Plus d'informations (site de la Magdalene Society of Medievalists)](https://magdalenemedievalists.wordpress.com/colloquia/)",

My analysis focuses primarily on three very popular and influential literary texts from the later Middle Ages, two in French and one in English: Jean de Meun’s _Roman de la Rose_ (ca. 1269–78), the two versions of Guillaume de Deguileville’s _Pèlerinage de Vie Humaine_ (1331 and 1355), and William Langland’s vision of _Piers Plowman_ in its 4 extant versions (ca. 1360–90). All three poems provide extended first-person accounts of quest narratives framed as dream visions, and respond to major shifts in scholastic philosophy occurring during the thirteenth century, specifically in the areas of philosophy of language and philosophy of mind. The first aim of the project is to explore the neglected question of how the two French allegories shape Langland’s poetic project and its evolution over time, with specific attention to Langland’s interest in processes of human knowledge. A second, related aim of the project is to contribute to our understanding of the larger question of the ‘philosophical’ uses of allegorical poetry, specifically its ability to address cognitive matters.',
