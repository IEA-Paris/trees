# Repository Update Convention

We follow the semantic versioning convention to upgrade the repository version [semver](https://semver.org/)

- For a major change in the project, upgrade the package version using:

  ```bash
  npm version major
  ```

- For a minor change, use the command:

  ```bash
  npm version minor
  ```

- For a fix (patch), use:

  ```bash
  npm version patch
  ```
